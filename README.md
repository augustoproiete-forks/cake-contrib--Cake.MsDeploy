# Cake.MsDeploy

Cake.MsDeploy is an Addin that extends [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/) for executing commands with the MsDeploy.exe (Web Deploy) command line interface (cli). 
In order to use this extension, [MsDeploy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=43717) will already have to be installed on the computer the cake build script is being executed on.
